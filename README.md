## Project Background
The idea for this project originated from a shared interest in language learning and pedagogy. Recognizing the significance of motivation in language acquisition, the group decided to investigate the effectiveness of the Hangman Game as a supplementary learning tool. The project builds upon existing research on language games and aims to contribute new insights into their educational value.

## Research Methodology
Our study employed a quantitative research design, targeting eighth-grade students at MTs Negeri Cirebon 1. Data was collected through questionnaires and observations, with statistical analysis revealing significant differences in motivation levels between experimental and control groups. The research methodology aimed to provide empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of the Hangman Game in enhancing language learning motivation.

## Motivation
Language games, such as the Hangman Game, offer an interactive and engaging approach to language learning. By immersing students in enjoyable linguistic activities, these games facilitate the acquisition of vocabulary and grammar skills. The intrinsic motivation derived from such games contributes to a more effective learning experience, as evidenced by our research findings.

## Project Overview
Implemented in Python, our Hangman Game features a graphical user interface (GUI) for an enhanced gaming experience. The game randomly selects words from a predefined list, challenging players to guess the word within a limited number of attempts. Through intuitive gameplay and informative feedback, the Hangman Game encourages players to expand their vocabulary and improve their language skills.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Pygame
- Word selection from a predefined list
- Intuitive gameplay with informative feedback
- Visual representation of game state and progress tracking
